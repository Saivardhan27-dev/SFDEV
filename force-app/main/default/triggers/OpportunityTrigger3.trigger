* Problem Statement:
* - When an Opportunity is marked as Closed Won:
  - Create a related Custom Object: Project__c record with details from the Opportunity.
  - Update all related Quote recordsâ€™ Status__c to "Approved".
  - If the Amount on Opportunity > 1,000,000, create a Task assigned to the Account Owner for a follow-up.
